  [join_list_to_index_bounded] is a lemma that states that for any list [s], join function [join_by], 
  indices [x] and [y], and a natural number [n], if the pair [(x, y)] is in the result of applying 
  [join_list_to_index] function on [s] with [join_by] and [n], then [x] is less than [n + length s].

  The proof of this lemma is done by induction on the list [s]. In the base case, when [s] is empty, 
  the assumption is contradicted. In the inductive case, we consider the head of the list [s] as a pair 
  [(a, b)]. If [a] is in the list [join_by], then we have two cases: either [(x, y)] is equal to [(a, b)], 
  in which case the inequality holds trivially, or [(x, y)] is in the rest of the list, in which case 
  we apply the induction hypothesis on the tail of the list. If [a] is not in the list [join_by], then 
  we also apply the induction hypothesis on the tail of the list.

  Finally, the inequality is proven using the [lia] tactic, which is able to handle linear integer 
  arithmetic.

  @param s2 The schema of the right-hand side relation.
  @param join_by The list of column names to join by.
  @param lhs The left-hand side tuple.

  @return An optional tuple containing the resulting tuple after the join operation and a list of triples where
          the first element is the id of the cell joined on the left-hand side, the second element is the id of
          the cell joined on the right-hand side, and the third element is the merged new id.

  The `tuple_concat_by` function performs a join operation on two tuples `lhs` and `rhs` based on the list of column
  names `join_by`. The schemas of the tuples are `s1` and `s2` respectively. If the join operation can be successfully
  applied, the function returns `Some` with a tuple containing the resulting tuple after the join operation and two
  lists of natural numbers. The two lists of natural numbers represent the indices of the columns from `lhs` and `rhs`
  that are included in the resulting tuple. If the join operation cannot be applied (for example, if a column name in 
  join_by` does not exist in either `lhs` or `rhs`), the function returns `None`.
