# PCD-Proof

This repository contains formalization for the dataframe data model and relational algebra semantics that captures the privacy policy and mechanically checked proofs of the correctness.

## Codebase layout

We provide a quick introduction on how this Coq codebase relates to the on-paper formalism.

TODO: Make things tidier by organizing things into sub-folders.

## Note

The codebase of Picachv's Coq formalism is still untidy and will be cleaned up as soon as possible. As for now, there might some naming issues and/or inconsistent terms between the Coq code and paper descriptions. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenince and will fix it.
